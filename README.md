# MPIN Analyzer

This project analyzes the strength of Mobile PINs (MPINs) based on common usage patterns and personal demographics such as:

- Date of Birth (DOB)
- Spouse's DOB
- Wedding Anniversary
- Commonly used PIN patterns

## Contents

- `common_used.py` - Contains frequently used PIN patterns and their analysis.
- `combinations.py` - Generates and evaluates possible MPIN combinations.
- `checker.py` - Verifies the strength of a given MPIN against common patterns.
- `test_case.py` - Includes test cases to validate the PIN checker system.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run each module independently or integrate it into a larger system to validate MPINs securely.

```bash
python common_used.py
python combinations.py
python checker.py
python test_case.py
```
